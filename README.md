# NODEJS FUNDAMENTALS

Repo to practice on node using the gidelines of the platzi course: Fundamentos de Node.js

## Learning

### Monohilo: implicaciones
- setinterval(fun,t) is a function with 2 params that execute 'fun' each 't' miliseconds
- Set interval does not block the main execution thread
- the eventLoop (EvLp) gives the order to execute it, but continues its way with the next instructions meanwhile
- A function writen after a setInterval() will execute immediately after the EvLp touch the setinterval() and its result will prompt before the timeout of the first
- Single threaded implies that an exception in any operation breaks all the application
- It is MANDATORY to have a careful error handling

### L5 - Configurar las variables de entorno en Node.js

- I can acces env vars with process.env.VAR_NAME
- an env var get assigned from the run line in the OS terminal > 'MY_VAR_NAME={varValue} node file.js'
- It is a pretty Common practice to write the environment variable names in snake uppercase
- All important and secret values like passwords and tokens should be treat in this way or alike


## To research

- nvm
- Event Loop, message queue, call stack L4
- librer√≠a dotenv L5
- var de entornos con la powershell L5
